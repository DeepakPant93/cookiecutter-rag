# CI/CD with Github actions

`.github` directory:

```yaml
.github
├── actions
│   └── setup-poetry-env
│       └── action.yml
└── workflows
├── build-and-deploy.yml
├── deploy-docs.yml
├── publish-package.yml
└── test-check-build.yml
```

The `.github` directory is a special directory in a GitHub repository that contains configuration files related to GitHub-specific features, such as GitHub Actions for CI/CD, issue templates, and pull request templates. In this case, your `.github` directory is configured to manage CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions. Here's a detailed explanation of each component and file:

---

### `.github` Directory

The `.github` directory contains subdirectories and files that define custom GitHub workflows and actions to automate tasks like testing, building, deploying, and publishing.

---

### 1. **`actions` Subdirectory**

The `actions` subdirectory contains reusable custom GitHub Actions. These are defined in YAML files and can be used across your workflows to perform specific tasks.

#### **`setup-poetry-env` Subdirectory**

This folder contains the configuration for a custom action that is likely used to set up a Python Poetry environment in your workflows.

-   **`action.yml`**
    This is the metadata file that defines the custom to setup a Python Poetry environment.

**Purpose**: This custom action streamlines the setup of the Poetry environment in your workflows, ensuring consistency and reusability.

---

### 2. **`workflows` Subdirectory**

The `workflows` directory contains YAML files that define GitHub Actions workflows. Each file represents a workflow that automates specific tasks, triggered by events like `push`, `pull_request`, or on a schedule.

#### **`build-and-deploy.yml`**

This workflow automates the build and deployment process for your project.

-   **Purpose**: Ensures that your application is built correctly and deployed to the intended environment (e.g., staging or production) after passing tests.
-   **Typical Steps**:
    -   Checkout the repository code.
    -   Build the project (e.g., compile code or containerize the application).
    -   Run tests to verify the build.
    -   Deploy the built artifact to the target environment (e.g., a server or cloud platform).

---

#### **`deploy-docs.yml`**

This workflow handles the deployment of your project documentation.

-   **Purpose**: Automates the generation and publishing of documentation to GitHub Pages.
-   **Typical Steps**:
    -   Generate documentation files using a mkdocs.
    -   Upload or deploy the generated documentation to GitHub Pages.

---

#### **`publish-package.yml`**

This workflow manages the publishing of your package to a PyPI package registry PyPI.

-   **Purpose**: Automates the process of packaging and releasing your software when a new version is tagged.
-   **Typical Steps**:
    -   Validate versioning (e.g., Semantic Versioning).
    -   Build the package (e.g., a Python wheel ).
    -   Publish the package to a registry (e.g., PyPI).

---

#### **`test-check-build.yml`**

This workflow ensures that your code is tested and validated for quality and correctness.

-   **Purpose**: Provides a continuous testing pipeline to maintain code integrity.
-   **Typical Steps**:
    -   Run automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
    -   Check code quality (e.g., using linters like `flake8` or `eslint`).
    -   Verify that the project builds successfully.

---

### Summary

Your `.github` directory is structured to manage and automate critical development tasks through GitHub Actions. Here's a quick overview:

-   **Custom Action (`setup-poetry-env`)**: Provides reusable functionality for setting up a Poetry environment.
-   **Workflows**:
    -   `build-and-deploy.yml`: Automates application building and deployment.
    -   `deploy-docs.yml`: Manages the deployment of project documentation.
    -   `publish-package.yml`: Handles publishing of your package to a registry.
    -   `test-check-build.yml`: Ensures code quality and integrity through automated testing and validation.

These configurations enable streamlined CI/CD processes, improving development efficiency and maintaining high-quality code practices.
